%     E_ = FDSE(X_,Y_,m_,a_,N,AC_FF) produces the Short-Time Fourier
%     Transform (STFT) E_ of the residual after FDSE of the STFT X_.

%     Y_ is the STFT of x_ forward one sample, i.e. X_=STFT(x_(1:end-1)),
%     while Y_=STFT(x_(2:end)). m_ is the vector of time indices where the
%     short-time spectra of X_ were evaluated. a_ and N are the coefficient
%     vector and the length of the cosine window used in the STFT. AC_FF is
%     a preliminary estimate of the pitch of the initial time-domain
%     signal.
