% Frequency-Domain String Extraction (FDSE)
%     E_ = FDSEE(X_,Y_,m_,a_,N,AC_FF) produces the Short-Time Fourier
%     Transform (STFT) E_ of the residual after FDSE of the STFT X_.
%
%     Y_ is the STFT of x_ forward one sample, i.e. X_=STFT(x_(1:end-1)),
%     while Y_=STFT(x_(2:end)). m_ is the vector of time indices where the
%     short-time spectra of X_ were evaluated. a_ and N are the coefficient
%     vector and the length of the cosine window used in the STFT. AC_FF is
%     a preliminary estimate of the pitch of the initial time-domain
%     signal.
% 
%     The function FDSEE is a simplified version of FDSE. FDSEE is
%     computationally cheaper and is more concise, but phantom partials, if
%     any, are ignored. Low-pitch tones should generally use FDSE, but
%     high-pitched tones, where phantom partials are negligible, should be
%     treated with FDSEE.
